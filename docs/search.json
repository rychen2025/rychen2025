    "text": "Comparison of whole genome sequencing and targeted sequencing for mitochondrial DNA\n\nPaper link\nMitochondrial dysfunction has emerged to be associated with a broad spectrum of diseases, and there is an increasing demand for accurate detection of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been the dominant sequencing approach to identify genetic variants in recent decades, but most studies focus on variants on the nuclear genome. Whole genome sequencing is also costly and time consuming. Sequencing specifically targeted for mtDNA is commonly used in the diagnostic settings and has lower costs. However, there is a lack of pairwise comparisons between these two sequencing approaches for calling mtDNA variants on a population basis. In this study, we compared WGS and mtDNA-targeted sequencing (targeted-seq) in analyzing mitochondrial DNA from 1499 participants recruited into the Severe Asthma Research Program(SARP). Our study reveals that targeted-sequencing and WGS have comparable capacity to determine genotypes and to call haplogroups and homoplasmies on mtDNA. However, there exists a large variability in calling heteroplasmies, especially for low-frequency heteroplasmies, which indicates that investigators should be cautious about heteroplasmies acquired from different sequencing methods. Further research is highly desired to improve variant detection methods for mitochondrial DNA.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

Welcome to my website!!\nMy name is Ruoying(Rosalyn) Chen, and I am a full-time research scientist at Cleveland Clinic and a part time graduate student at Case Western Reserve University.\nCurrently, I am involved in several projects, including the Severe Asthma Research Program (SARP) under the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) initiative, as well as Redefining Pulmonary Hypertension through Pulmonary Vascular Disease Phenomics (PVDOMICS), funded by the NHLBI. The goal of SARP is to find the genetic factors for severe asthma. PVDOMICS aims to improve the current classification of pulmonary hypertension (PH) by focusing on shared biological features from different levels. Our objective is to deepen our understanding of these diseases through a multi-level approach, encompassing DNA (whole genome sequencing, including mitochondrial genome), transcriptomics (RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing), post-transcriptional modifications (DNA methylation), as well as at protein and metabolic levels.\nOutside of work and study, I enjoy cooking and spending time with my family. I also like to travel and explore new national parks.\nOn this website, you will find my published works. You will also find news and updates on my current research projects. I invite you to explore my website and learn more about me.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."
